## Data Understanding
1) Data Description: Parking Violations Issuance datasets contain violations issued during the respective fiscal year. The Issuance datasets are not updated to reflect violation status, the information only represents the violation(s) at the time they are issued. Since appearing on an issuance dataset, a violation may have been paid, dismissed via a hearing, statutorily expired, or had other changes to its status. To see the current status of outstanding parking violations, please look at the Open Parking & Camera Violations dataset.
2) Data Exploration Report: 14.4M rows and 43 columns. 
3) Data Quality Report:

## Data Preparation
1) Select Data: Which columns are important for our task etc
2) Clean Data: Only if necessary. Probably useful to remove rows with NaN, 0, blank or wrong(dates in the future e.g.) values.
3) Merge/Augment Data: With  
  a) Weather Information,  
  b) Vicinity/Location of primary and high schools  
  c) Information about events in vicinity  
  d) Vicinity/Location of major businesses  
  e) Vicinity/Location of major attractions  
4) Format Data: Only if necessary.

## notes
hypothesen aufstellen
weather data for districts
business areas definieren (> 50 businesses in einer area) und nehmen das dann als ganzes
spatial map for school start and school end for parking ticket violations in a certain area around schools
correlation of events in may vs parking tickets (maybe example events like fashion week and pride parade etc)
